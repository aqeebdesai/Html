    <!--Div tag is container used for styling like if we want to color multiple elements at the same time instead of colouring it one by one. We can have multiple div tags and also nested div tags are also supported.-->

  
    <div>
        <p>This is a para</p>
        <big>This is a big</big>
        <a href="xyz">Xyz</a>
    </div>
 <!--Now if you inspect element ans click on div it selects all three p big and a togher
it means if you apply any css javasript or text style then it will apply to all 3 of them-->

  <!--Div tag is block element so whatever there in the div it will also take full width-->
  <!-- If you inspect and hover mouse on anchor tag is show only space taken by anchor text but if hover mouse on div tag then it shows that it takes full width if you want that should not take full tag then you need use the span tag-->
